/**
 * MCP servers become loop tools — after verification, and never above it.
 *
 * Three rules from the threat model (§c-bis), each visible here:
 *  1. A server whose tools do not match their pinned hashes is SUSPENDED: no
 *     tool registered, one report line, re-approval is the only way back.
 *  2. Third-party descriptions are data, not instructions: fenced with a
 *     nonce, and MCP tools are appended after every internal tool.
 *  3. Every result is tier 3 and fenced — it raises the turn's taint like any
 *     other untrusted content, which is what disarms the poisoned-result
 *     attack downstream (the kernel refuses tainted turns the sensitive
 *     capabilities).
 *
 * One capability per server (`mcp.<name>`): medium risk, host-only, default
 * taint ceiling 1 — a turn already carrying untrusted content cannot reach
 * out through a third-party server at all.
 *
 * That ceiling used to be INHERITED from the class default, and the sentence
 * above was only true because `policy.json` may lower the default and never
 * raise it (`core/policy/matrix.ts`, `tighter`). A judge measured the version
 * where it could: `{"medium":3}` in a resealed file made this a silent `allow`
 * at taint 3. Since ADR-0053 it is held by the `external` row instead — same
 * number, now stated rather than inherited, which is what that measurement
 * asked for.
